Hello, I'm Drew!

I received an MS in aerospace engineering at UT Austin under Efstathios Bakolas. My thesis was in categorical/polymorphic Kalman filtering, and I've also collaborated on a paper in that topic. My primary interests are in systems, controls, and estimation, often from a categorical perspective. I'm active in the applied category theory community, and I am on the organizing committee for [The Adjoint School](https://adjointschool.com). I currently teach math in Camden, NJ.
